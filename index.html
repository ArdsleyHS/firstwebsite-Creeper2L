             <li>The blue whale has a heart the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. Its stomach can hold one ton of krill and it needs to eat about four tons of krill each day.</li>
             <li>They are the loudest animals on Earth and are even louder than a jet engine.</li>

                 <li>Their calls reach 188 decibels, while a jet reaches 140 decibels.</li>
                 <li>Their low frequency whistle can be heard for hundreds of miles and is probably used to attract other blue whales.</li>
